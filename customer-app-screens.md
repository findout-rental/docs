## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document defines all screens, navigation flows, and UI components for the FindOut customer mobile application. It serves as a comprehensive reference for:

- **Flutter developers** implementing the mobile app
- **Backend developers** understanding required API endpoints
- **UI/UX designers** creating visual designs
- **QA engineers** testing application flows

### 1.2 Scope

The customer mobile app supports **two distinct user roles**:

- **Tenants**: Users who search for and book apartments
- **Owners**: Users who list and manage apartments

**Important**: A user's role is fixed at registration and cannot be changed. The app provides different navigation structures and features based on the user's role.

### 1.3 Design Principles

- **Material Design** for Android, **Cupertino** for iOS
- **Responsive layouts** supporting various screen sizes (phones and tablets)
- **RTL/LTR support** for Arabic and English languages
- **Dark/Light theme** support throughout the app
- **Accessibility** considerations for all interactive elements

## 2. Navigation Architecture

### 2.1 Role-Based Navigation

The application uses **separate navigation structures** for Tenants and Owners, determined at login based on the user's role.

#### 2.1.1 Tenant Navigation Structure

**Bottom Navigation Bar** (5 tabs):

| Tab | Icon | Screen | Description |
|-----|------|--------|-------------|
| Home | 🏠 | Apartment Browse | Browse and search apartments |
| Bookings | 📅 | Booking History | View all bookings (current, past, cancelled) |
| Favorites | ❤️ | Favorites List | Saved apartments |
| Messages | 💬 | Message Conversations | Chat with apartment owners |
| Profile | 👤 | Profile | User profile and settings |

#### 2.1.2 Owner Navigation Structure

**Bottom Navigation Bar** (4 tabs):

| Tab | Icon | Screen | Description |
|-----|------|--------|-------------|
| My Apartments | 🏢 | Apartment Management | List and manage owned apartments |
| Bookings | 📋 | Booking Requests | View and approve/reject booking requests |
| Messages | 💬 | Message Conversations | Chat with tenants |
| Profile | 👤 | Profile | User profile and settings |

**Note**: Owners do NOT have a "Home" or "Favorites" tab since they cannot book apartments.

### 2.2 Navigation Behavior

- **Persistent Bottom Navigation**: Visible on all main screens
- **Stack Navigation**: Used for detail screens, forms, and modals
- **Deep Linking**: Support for push notification navigation
- **Back Button**: Standard Android back button behavior
- **iOS Swipe**: Support for iOS swipe-back gesture

### 2.3 Top App Bar Pattern

Most screens include a top app bar with:

- **Title**: Screen name or context
- **Left Action**: Back button (on detail screens) or menu icon (on main screens)
- **Right Actions**: Notifications bell icon (with unread badge), other contextual actions
